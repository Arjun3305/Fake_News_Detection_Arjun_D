# Fake_News_Detection_Arjun_D
# Semantic Classification Assignment – Fake News Detection

## 🔍 Objective
To classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using semantic features from text and machine learning models. This project uses Word2Vec embeddings along with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers for prediction.
